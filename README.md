# **Redshift: MITM Made Easy**

Redshift is a simple tool designed to perform **_Man-In-The-Middle_ (MITM)** attacks on **unencrypted networks**.
This tool is intended for **educational and cybersecurity research** purposes, allowing you to **test and assess**
the vulnerabilities of unprotected networks.  

The name is inspired by the **_redshift effect_**, which describes how an electromagnetic wave emitted
by a receding object is perceived with a longer wavelength, symbolizing an **alteration of information in transit**.  

Moreover, the first experiment using this tool aimed at altering the operation of an IoT device by triggering
an unnecessary **emergency procedure**, which turned on a **red LED** instead of a green one (**shifting to red**).

## **Installation**
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/checcoalt/redshift.git
  cd redshift
  sudo ./installer.sh
```
This installation is intended for **Debian/Ubuntu-based** Linux distributions and will provide **python3** and **pip3**,
if not installed, along with all the required Python libraries for Redshift.
